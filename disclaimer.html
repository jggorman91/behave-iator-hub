            <h1>Important Disclaimers and Terms of Use for Behave-iator Hub</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Behave-iator Hub! We are dedicated to providing helpful resources and tools for educators. Please read the following important disclaimers carefully:</p>

            <h2>1. Educational and Informational Purposes Only</h2>
            <p>The content, tools, behavior plan generators, lesson unit creators, data collection systems, and any other materials provided on Behave-iator Hub (collectively, "Materials") are for educational and informational purposes only. They are intended to serve as starting points and templates to assist educators in their professional practice.</p>

            <h2>2. Not a Substitute for Professional Judgment or Individualized Assessment</h2>
            <p>The Materials provided by Behave-iator Hub are not a substitute for the professional judgment of qualified educators, Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs), psychologists, teachers, or other relevant professionals. The tools and information provided do not constitute psychological, behavioral, educational, or therapeutic advice. Always seek the advice of qualified professionals for any specific student needs or concerns. The use of these Materials does not create a client-professional relationship.</p>

            <h2>3. Individualization Required</h2>
            <p>All behavior plans, lesson units, data collection systems, and other strategies suggested or generated by our tools must be individualized to meet the specific needs of each student, considering their unique context, strengths, challenges, and relevant data. Strategies should be adapted and modified in consultation with the student's educational team and, where appropriate, parents/guardians. The information provided in the uploaded document "Behavior Replacement Strategy Guide (K-8)" explicitly states that "Implementation should be individualized and aligned with student needs, context, and data." This principle applies to all Materials on this website.</p>

            <h2>4. No Guarantees</h2>
            <p>Behave-iator Hub makes no guarantees or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, efficacy, or specific outcomes of using the Materials. Behavior change and educational progress are complex and depend on numerous factors. We do not guarantee that the use of our tools will result in specific behavioral improvements or educational achievements.</p>

            <h2>5. Role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human Curation</h2>
            <p>Some of the foundational information and templates available on Behave-iator Hub may have been developed with the assistance of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, including models from OpenAI (ChatGPT) and Google (Gemini). However, all Materials presented have been reviewed, curated, and refined by Joseph Gorman, Behavior Support Professional, M.Ed to align with evidence-based practices and ethical considerations in education. Users should be aware that AI-generated content can sometimes be imperfect or incomplete.</p>

            <h2>6. User Responsibility and Vetting of Information</h2>
            <p>Users are solely responsible for how they use the Materials provided by Behave-iator Hub. It is your responsibility to critically evaluate the information and any generated outputs for accuracy and appropriateness before application. You should cross-reference information and ensure it aligns with your professional training and the specific circumstances.</p>

            <h2>7. Compliance with Laws, Policies, and Ethical Codes</h2>
            <p>Users of Behave-iator Hub are responsible for ensuring that their use of the Materials complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, as well as school district policies, professional ethical codes (such as those from the Behavior Analyst Certification Board® for BCBAs), and any other relevant regulations.</p>

            <h2>8. Data Privacy</h2>
            <p>Currently, Behave-iator Hub is a static website that does not actively collect personal user data. If this changes in the future, a separate Privacy Policy will be provided to detail how we collect, use, and protect any personal information you may provide to us.</p>
